# See Ch4.cpp for examples or read Redbook 2.1 p186.

# Before rendering:
	glEnable( GL_CULL_FACE );
	glFrontFace( GL_CCW ); // Default but being explicit
	glEnable( GL_DEPTH_TEST );
	
# At the beginning of each frame:
	glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT );
	
# Why?
- CULL_FACE removes inner faces.  For example, a cube has 6 sides, without CULL_FACE
  you'd be rendering 6 outer faces and 6 inner faces (12 total) but the 6 inner are
  wasted if you can't see the inside.
  
- DEPTH_TEST and DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT remove objects hidden by other objects to save work
